üåê Host a Website on Amazon S3

Welcome to the project where we harness the power of Amazon S3 to host a static website! This guide will walk you through each step, ensuring you have a live website by the end.

üìã Project Overview

In this project, we utilize Amazon S3 to host a static website. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable storage service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a publicly accessible static website.

üõ†Ô∏è Steps Followed
1. Create an S3 Bucket
Creating an S3 bucket is the first step. Here's how:

Bucket Name: my-unique-bucket-name
Region: Selected eu-west-2 (London) for low latency
ACLs: Enabled Access Control Lists and allowed public access

2. Upload Website Files
Next, we upload the necessary files for the website:

Files Uploaded: index.html and a zip file containing additional assets

3. Configure Static Website Hosting
Configure the S3 bucket to serve static content:

4. Set File Permissions
To ensure the website is accessible, set the permissions of the files to public:

File Permissions: Adjusted ACLs to make the contents public

üéâ Conclusion
We successfully hosted a static website on Amazon S3. This project demonstrated the process of creating a bucket, uploading files, configuring static website hosting, and setting the necessary permissions to make the website publicly accessible.

‚ú® One Thing I Didn't Expect
One unexpected aspect was adjusting file permissions to ensure that the website's assets were publicly accessible.

‚è±Ô∏è Project Duration
The project took about an hour as I took the time to understand each step deeply.
